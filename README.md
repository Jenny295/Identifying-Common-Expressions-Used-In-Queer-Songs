Disclaimer: In the realm of matters concerning LGBTQIA+, gender, sexual orientation, queerness and so on it is crucial to approach any data or information with a deep sense of sensitivity, caution and respect for the complexity of human identity. I would like to emphasize that the data presented here may not be an absolute reflection and may not always offer a comprehensive or accurate representation of reality, as not everyone discloses their identity openly, and individual experiences can evolve over time. Therefore it is really difficult to find currently correct non-assumed data.  
It is of utmost importance to avoid making assumptions about someone's identity or orientation. Instead, to encourage open-mindedness, empathy, and a commitment to creating a safe and inclusive space for everyone should be the goal. Recognizing that identities and orientations are deeply personal is important, individuals may not always conform to societal expectations or labels and people can change their minds.  
In an effort to foster a more understanding and inclusive environment, the information provided here can be used as a starting point for learning and discussion, rather than as definitive statements about individuals or groups.
